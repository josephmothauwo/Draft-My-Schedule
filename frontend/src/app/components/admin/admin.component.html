    <h2>DMCA Takedown Workflow</h2>
    <p>First the copywrite owner will investigate whether the content is infringing on their own content and does not fall under fair use. Then the user can send a takedown notice to the site with reason for the takedown request via the takedown notice option in their user account. This notice will be recorded in the database. The company will then email the user in question and tell them that they have 2 business days to either modify or takedown their content. If the user does not modify it then the company will use its right to hide the review with the correct ID. If the user does modify their content then the new review ID will be sent to the orignal content owner to checked. If the user in question does not belive the orignal takedown request was valid they can send a counter notice. If the review was already tken down then the content will be unhidden and posted back up by the site manager. The original user will have to pursue legal action in court if they want the content to be taken down</p>
